Things we still have to do FOR MVP:
-Deepti: make sure marker rendering is working on the map with the way we came up with (to send through AJAX list of locations that have been rendered for that session)
-Deepti: Implement dietary restrictions showing up on the map with restricting the search iteration
-Deepti: For profile page, figure out how to render the recipes one user has posted (write the script for a smooth scrolling portion of the page where the right number of recipe will titles will render)
-Deepti: when a marker is clicked (on both home and profile page), render popup with correct recipe
-Deepti: fix routes in the website
-Deepti: fix flash messages thing for wrong password/username with logged in
-Deepti: implement upvoting (should be simple)
-Deepti: figure out how to do profile page with the specific user IDs in URL

***FOR BOTH SEARCH AND PROFILE: when you click on a recipe title link, will bring you to the location on the map where you have posted that recipe and will animate it-figure out how this works

-Kim: write a search algorithm to allow users to search our database based on keywords in title<----yussss this is done (make into re.json post request for kiran)
and later ingredients list
-Kim: once deepti signs up for an S3 account, figure out how photo uploading works for database and integrate that in
-Kim: integrate app tomorrow with heroku so we can see it deployed
-Kim: top 5?10? recipes in current view by upvotes (sort the input)
---input: array of arrays for which each array gives you title, dishtype, upvotes 
---output: top recipes by 
-Kim: Fix recipe list so it doesn't look shitty



Kiran: fix the hiding/showing buttons for login/logout, as well as how the popup boxes change
-Create modal views for recipe popups when markers come, upvoting
-Create a search results page as well as correct profile page
-Geocoding issues-can;t put markers over water

MOST IMPORTANT TO WORK ON BEFORE TUESDAY:
1.  Rendering markers with minimal work
2.  Viewing recipe popups
2.  Search/search results page
3.  Uploading photos


AFTER MVP:
1.  Spend Tuesday night filling in all missing pieces (add ALL fields we want to recipe form-i.e. instructions, etc, all the things to create one's profile)
2.  Spend Tuesday night (Kiran) making the site look basically how we want it to look for final result
3.  Deepti-figure out how the hell Charles is going to break our site and break and put as much security as you can
FEATURES FOR AFTER MVP:
-Heat map based on upvotes (cool visual!!!)
-Top 10 recipes by location  by upvotes (kim could you work on this? after?)
-Kiran: create all the missing pages (about us, 404 error page with sad gobis, etc)
-Deepti: put routes to all those pages


WE HAVE TO STOP IMPLEMENTING FEATURES BY FRIDAY NIGHT AND DEVOTE THE REST OF THE TIME TO FINDING BUGS!!!!!
